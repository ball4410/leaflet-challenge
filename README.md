# leaflet-challenge
This challenge visualizes earthquake data taken from United States Geological Survey.
I am specifically using all earthquake data from the last 30 days. 
The map is created using leaflet and plots the data from the set specified. 
The color of the data markers represent the magnitude of the earthquake and the size of the markers represents their depth. 
When a marker is clicked, there is a pop up that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
There is also a legend in the bottom right of the map for color~magnitude relationship.
